<!-- #20 use topic_post_url. This is very important.
       When we use _path we get a "relative URL", such as "topics/3".
         This works within the context of the website because the browser already knows the base URL.
           But when a user sees this email, they won't be in the application and thus won't have the base URL.
             Therefore, we have to define it. That is what _url does.
               It generates an "absolute URL", such as "http://myapp.com/topics/3" -->
      <%= link_to "View Comment on site", topic_post_url(@post.topic, @post, anchor: "comment-#{@comment.id}") %>
    </p>
